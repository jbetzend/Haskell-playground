WichtelWizard
=============

A small haskell program to manage secret santas for multiple people.
All participants and parameters still need to be hardcoded. All participants recieve an e-mail with a little discription and the name of the person they are supposed to get a present for.

Uses SMTP-MAIL, a quite useful package for sending Mails, that can be found here:
